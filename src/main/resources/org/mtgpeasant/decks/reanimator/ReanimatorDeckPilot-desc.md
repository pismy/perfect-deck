# \[Peasant & Pauper\] Reanimator Pilot

This is a [reanimator](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Reanimator) deck pilot for [Peasant](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Peasant_(format\)) and [Pauper](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Pauper).

Goldfish win conditions are reached when a creature is reanimated at EOT (which is not the end of the game in real life but which 
is what we are optimizing here).

## Mulligan strategy

Reanimator is a combo deck that relies on 3 pieces:

* a large creature (the menace),
* a discard outlet,
* a reanimation spell.

* On the draw with 0 mulligans: keeps a hand with 1 creature + 1 reanimation spell (possibly draw, discard EOT and reanimated T2),
* Keeps a hand with the 3 pieces of the combo + required mana to cast it,
* Keeps a hand with only 2 pieces of the combo + required mana to cast it + something to draw (ex: Gitaxian Probe, Faithless Looting),
* Always keep a hand after 3 mulligans,
